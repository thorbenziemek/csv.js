jscsv
=====

jscsv is a lightweight implementation of a CSV parser in JavaScript.

Why do I need this?
-------------------
Most implementations you can find in forums either do not conform to the CSV RFC
(http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4180) or require other libraries and environments. This parser
does not depend on any third-party library and hence can be included anywhere. You could use
it for previewing csv uploads right in the browser, for example (this is what I intended to do with it).

Look at the code if you already want to use it (yes, it works! check out the example), but note that this is work in progress. Be sure to compress the code with YUI Compressor or something like that if you use it in production.
